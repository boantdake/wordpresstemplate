This is another basic wordpress theme, only difference is that it is configured to use the bootstrap framework. So as is common I have named it Wordstrap. This project was fun and will be continually updated as time goes on. It has Comment functionality that was styled with Bootstrap and Looks pretty plain jane but it is easily customizable.
